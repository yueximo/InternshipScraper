A very basic webscraper that gives you the newest SWE internships on LinkedIn.

I reccomend you use the link that contains all the internships within the last week. This will allow you to build up a good majority of internships. Then in future use you can use the link that only contains internships within the last 24 hours.

Run "pip install selenium" before using.

Simply run the python program and it will create/update the json files for you.
